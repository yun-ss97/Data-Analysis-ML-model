I used various machine learning techniques learned from Machine Learning course and made model by using each ML technique.
To be speicific, I've tried Decision Tree, Bayesian Approach, Logistic Regression, MLP, and Deep Learning. By comparing the performance of each model and in the viewpoint of 'overfitting', I've selected the final model.
